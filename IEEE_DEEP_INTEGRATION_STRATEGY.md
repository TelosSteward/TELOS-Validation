## IEEE Organizational Structure

### What IEEE Actually Is

**IEEE is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit public charity** - the world's largest technical professional organization with:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Members** | 486,000+ globally |
| **Technical Societies** | 39 specialized societies |
| **Geographic Regions** | 10 global regions |
| **Active Standards** | 1,900+ standards |
| **Tax Status** | 501(c)(3) charitable organization |
| **Founded** | 1963 (roots to 1884) |

The IEEE Standards Association (IEEE SA) is a separately governed body within IEEE that manages standards development, Industry Connections programs, and certification initiatives like CertifAIEd.

---

## The Pathway: From Certification to Core Member

### Phase 1: CertifAIEd Product Certification (Current)

**Status:** Interest submitted

This is the entry point, but you're right - certification alone makes TELOS a *customer*, not a *contributor*. The goal is to use certification as a springboard to deeper involvement.

### Phase 2: IEEE SA Individual Membership

**Cost:** ~$236/year (includes IEEE + IEEE SA)

**Benefits:**
- Vote on standards ballots (unlimited)
- Hold Working Group positions
- Participate in governance elections
- Leadership eligibility in standards activities

**Action:** Join IEEE SA immediately - this is table stakes for any deeper involvement.

### Phase 3: P7001 Working Group Participation

This is where you directly intersect with **Dr. Nell Watson's domain**.

**IEEE P7001 - Transparency of Autonomous Systems**

| Role | Person |
|------|--------|
| **Vice Chair** | Dr. Nell Watson (your ally) |
| **Chair** | Alan Winfield |
| **Scope** | Measurable, testable levels of transparency |

**Why P7001 is Perfect for TELOS:**

TELOS's real-time fidelity display and complete audit trails are *exactly* what P7001 defines as transparency. You could:

1. **Contribute TELOS as a reference implementation** of P7001 transparency levels
2. **Provide validation data** (11,208 governance events) as empirical evidence
3. **Co-author technical reports** with the Working Group

**How to Join:**
1. Sign up via IEEE myProject system
2. Contact Working Group officers directly
3. Attend meetings (face-to-face or virtual)
4. Contribute to standards drafting

### Phase 4: IEEE CertifAIEd Authorized Assessor

**The Training:**
- 3.5 days virtual instruction
- Exam at conclusion
- Case for Competence application
- Panel interview and evaluation

**What You'd Become:**

An **IEEE CertifAIEd Authorized Assessor** is someone who:
- Guides organizations through ethics assessment
- Determines ethical risk/reward profiles
- Certifies AIS conformance with IEEE criteria

**Strategic Value:**

As a certified product holder AND an assessor, you would:
- Understand the assessment process from both sides
- Build relationships with other assessors (304 currently)
- Contribute to assessment methodology evolution
- Train others on ethical AI implementation

**Currently Only 304 Authorized Assessors Exist Globally** - this is a small, influential group.

### Phase 5: IEEE SA Entity Membership

When TELOS AI Labs Inc. is ready to scale involvement:

**Tiers Based on Organization Size:**
- Unlimited balloting privileges
- Leadership position eligibility
- Voting on entity-based projects
- Network access to corporate members

### Phase 6: IEEE Global Initiative 2.0 Participation

The **IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems** is the umbrella program that:

- Supervises all P7000 series standards
- Develops "Ethically Aligned Design" principles
- Creates sector-specific toolkits
- Guides policy discourse on AI

**How to Join:**
- Complete the Global Initiative interest form
- Join specific Working Groups (P7000, P7001, P7002, etc.)
- Contribute to toolkit development
- Participate in policy discussions

**New Focus Area (Perfect for TELOS):**
> "An exploration into an additional family of standards, specifically targeting generative AI technologies and large language models"

TELOS's governance architecture for LLMs could directly inform this new standards family.

---

## The Ultimate Goal: Reference Implementation Status

### Precedent: City of Vienna

In 2021, **Vienna became the first city to earn IEEE CertifAIEd certification**. They positioned their "Digital Humanism" strategy as a model for others.

### TELOS as Reference Implementation

TELOS could become the **reference implementation** for:

1. **IEEE 7000-2021** - Your PA architecture is a concrete implementation of "ethical values throughout system design"

2. **IEEE 7001-2021** - Your fidelity display and traces demonstrate measurable transparency levels

3. **IEEE 7003-2024** - Your XSTest calibration shows quantifiable bias mitigation

4. **IEEE 7010-2020** - Your purpose-aligned governance addresses "impact on human well-being"

### How to Achieve Reference Status

1. **Publish Case Study** through IEEE channels
2. **Present at IEEE Conferences** (ETHICS, AIES, etc.)
3. **Co-author Technical Reports** with Working Group members
4. **Provide Validation Data** for standards development
5. **Train Others** using TELOS as the teaching example

## Why TELOS is "Their Poster Child"

You're absolutely right that TELOS embodies what the IEEE AI ethics initiative has been building toward. Here's why:

| IEEE Principle | TELOS Implementation | Unique Value |
|----------------|---------------------|--------------|
| **Transparency** (7001) | Real-time fidelity scores visible to users | Mathematical, not aspirational |
| **Accountability** (7000) | 11,208 governance events with full audit trails | Runtime-auditable, EU AI Act ready |
| **Bias Mitigation** (7003) | XSTest calibration: 24.8% → 8.0% | Quantified improvement |
| **Privacy** (7002) | Privacy modes, local processing | HIPAA-aligned |
| **Well-Being** (7010) | Purpose-aligned governance | Dignity-preserving redirects |

**Key Differentiator:** Most AI ethics work is *theoretical*. TELOS has **validated empirical results**:
- 0% ASR across 2,550 attacks
- 99.9% statistical confidence
- Complete forensic traces

This is exactly what standards bodies need: **working implementations that prove the principles are achievable**.

---

## Dr. Nell Watson's Specific Alignment

As **Vice Chair of P7001 (Transparency)** and author of books on algorithmic trust, Dr. Watson's focus areas map directly to TELOS:

| Her Focus | TELOS Feature |
|-----------|---------------|
| "Technical mechanisms to safeguard algorithmic trust" | Primacy Attractor enforcement |
| Transparency as testable/measurable | Fidelity scores with defined zones |
| Accountability traceability | GovernanceTraceCollector JSONL |
| User-facing explainability | Color-coded intervention rationale |

**Recommended Approach with Dr. Watson:**

1. Send the IEEE CertifAIEd Evidence Package as "proof of concept"
2. Offer TELOS as a P7001 case study for the Working Group
3. Propose co-authoring a technical paper on "Practical Transparency Implementation"
4. Ask about contributing to the upcoming LLM standards initiative

---

## Conclusion

IEEE isn't just a certification body - it's a **community** of people defining how AI should work. The pathway to becoming "one of their own" is:

1. **Credential** - Membership, certification, assessor status
2. **Contribute** - Working group participation, technical reports
3. **Lead** - Officer positions, reference implementations
4. **Shape** - New standards development, policy influence

With Dr. Watson already committed and TELOS's validated results, you have a rare opportunity to move quickly from "certified product" to "standards contributor" to "thought leader."

The 304 Authorized Assessors, the Working Group officers, the people writing these standards - that's the community. And TELOS has the empirical evidence to earn a seat at that table.
