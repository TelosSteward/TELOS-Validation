**Version:** 1.0

---

## IEEE 7000-2021 Overview

> **Abstract:** "A set of processes by which organizations can include consideration of ethical values throughout the stages of concept exploration and development is established by this standard. Management and engineering in transparent communication with selected stakeholders for ethical values elicitation and prioritization is supported by this standard, involving traceability of ethical values through an operational concept, value propositions, and value dispositions in the system design."
>
> **Scope:** "The standard establishes a set of processes by which engineers and technologists can include consideration of ethical values throughout the stages of concept exploration and development, which encompass system initiation, analysis, and design. This standard provides engineers and technologists with an implementable process aligning innovation management processes, system design approaches, and software engineering methods to help address ethical concerns or risks during system design. IEEE Std 7000™ does not give specific guidance on the design of algorithms to apply ethical values such as fairness and privacy."
>
> **Purpose:** "The goal of this standard is to enable organizations to design systems with explicit consideration of individual and societal ethical values, such as transparency, sustainability, privacy, fairness, and accountability, as well as values typically considered in system engineering, such as efficiency and effectiveness."

### IEEE 7000 Key Concepts Mapping

#### 1. Ethical Value Register (EVR)

IEEE 7000 requires maintaining a register of ethical values relevant to the system.

| EVR Requirement | TELOS Implementation |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Identify relevant ethical values** | PA templates capture domain-specific values (healthcare, education, child safety, etc.) |
| **Document value definitions** | Each PA includes explicit purpose statement and constraints |
| **Prioritize values** | Fidelity thresholds mathematically encode priority (higher threshold = higher priority) |
| **Track value changes** | Session-level PA configuration recorded in traces |

**TELOS EVR Equivalent:** Primacy Attractor Configuration

```
PA Configuration = {
  purpose: "Ethical value statement",
  domain: "Application context",
  constraints: ["Value-derived boundaries"],
  thresholds: {
    green: 0.70,   // Aligned
    yellow: 0.60,  // Minor drift
    orange: 0.50,  // Drift detected
    red: 0.48      // Intervention required
  }
}
```

#### 2. Concept of Operations (ConOps)

IEEE 7000 requires documenting how ethical values translate to operational behavior.

| ConOps Requirement | TELOS Implementation |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| **Operational scenarios** | PA templates define expected interaction patterns |
| **Value-aligned behaviors** | Fidelity zones define response behaviors per value alignment |
| **Exception handling** | Three-tier escalation (PA → RAG → Expert) |
| **Stakeholder interactions** | Steward persona mediates user interactions |

**TELOS ConOps:** Two-Layer Fidelity System

```
Layer 1: Raw Similarity Check (baseline 0.20)
  → Catches extreme off-topic (value violation)

Layer 2: Basin Membership Check (threshold 0.70)
  → Catches purpose drift (value erosion)

Intervention Decision:
  should_intervene = (raw_similarity < 0.20) OR (fidelity < 0.70)
```

#### 3. Value-Based Requirements

IEEE 7000 requires deriving system requirements from ethical values.

| Value | Derived Requirement | TELOS Implementation |
|-------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Transparency** | System must explain decisions | Fidelity score displayed; intervention rationale provided |
| **Accountability** | Decisions must be traceable | JSONL audit trail with full context |
| **Privacy** | User data must be protected | Privacy modes in trace collector |
| **Fairness** | System must not discriminate | Domain-specific PA calibration (XSTest validation) |
| **Safety** | System must prevent harm | 0% ASR across 2,550 adversarial attacks |

#### 4. Ethical Risk Assessment

IEEE 7000 requires identifying and mitigating ethical risks.

| Risk Category | TELOS Mitigation | Validation Evidence |
|---------------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Harmful content generation** | PA boundary enforcement | AILuminate: 0% ASR (1,200 prompts) |
| **Privacy violations** | HIPAA-aligned PA; privacy modes | MedSafetyBench: 0% ASR (900 attacks) |
| **Child safety violations** | Conservative thresholds | SB 243: 0% ASR, 74% FPR (intentional) |
| **Bias amplification** | Domain-specific calibration | XSTest: 24.8% → 8.0% over-refusal |
| **Accountability gaps** | Three-tier escalation | Tier 3 requires human expert |

## Recommendations for Assessment

### Strengths to Highlight

1. **Mathematical Formalization** - TELOS translates ethical values into quantifiable embedding-space constraints (Primacy Attractors)

2. **Comprehensive Traceability** - 11,208+ governance events recorded with full context exceeds IEEE 7000 requirements

3. **Validated Safety** - 0% ASR across 2,550 attacks provides empirical evidence of ethical risk mitigation

4. **Transparency by Design** - Real-time fidelity display aligns with IEEE 7001 principles (Dr. Watson's focus area)

5. **Bias Quantification** - XSTest results demonstrate measurable bias mitigation capability per IEEE 7003

### Areas for Discussion

1. **Human-in-the-Loop** - Tier 3 escalation process could be further documented for IEEE 7000 ConOps

2. **Stakeholder Engagement** - Formal stakeholder value elicitation process could be added

3. **Long-term Monitoring** - Drift detection over extended deployments
