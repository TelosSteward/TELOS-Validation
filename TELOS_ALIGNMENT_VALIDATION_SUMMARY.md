## Purpose

This document provides a consolidated summary of TELOS's alignment with established AI safety and governance standards. It presents what has been built and validated against recognized frameworks in the field.

---

## Design Provenance

TELOS development began in January 2025, driven by three first principles:

1. **Transparency** - Every governance decision must be observable and explainable
2. **Auditability** - Complete records of system behavior must be maintained
3. **Human-in-the-Loop Agency** - Human authority must be architecturally guaranteed, not assumed

These principles preceded any external framework assessment. When the Safer Agentic AI (SAAI) Framework was published by Dr. Nell Watson in January 2026, we mapped TELOS against it and confirmed 88% alignment with requirements we had already implemented.

### Timeline

| Period | Work |
|--------|------|
| **January 2025** | TELOS development begins. Primacy Attractor concept, proportional control architecture |
| **Q1-Q2 2025** | Core implementation: fidelity engine, governance trace collector, two-layer detection |
| **Q3-Q4 2025** | Adversarial validation: AILuminate, MedSafetyBench, XSTest calibration |
| **January 2026** | SAAI Framework published by Dr. Nell Watson |
| **January 2026** | SAAI mapping performed - 88% alignment confirmed |
| **January 2026** | Remaining gaps closed (~70 lines of code for hash chains, tiered thresholds) |

One full year of development preceded SAAI publication.

## Original Design Methodology

From the TELOS Whitepaper, the founding design principles:

**Proportional Control Law:**
```
F = K · e, where e = |x - PA| / r
```
Correction force scales with deviation magnitude. Standard control engineering applied to semantic space.

**Primacy Basin Geometry:**
```
B(PA, r) = {x in R^d : |x - PA| <= r}
```
The safe operating region is mathematically defined.

**Stability Foundation:**
The architecture uses Lyapunov-inspired stability analysis:
```
V(x) = (1/2)|x - PA|^2
```
This provides theoretical grounding for convergence toward the attractor. Implemented in the fidelity engine; formal empirical convergence analysis pending.

**DMAIC Integration:**
Alignment framed as Statistical Process Control:
- Define: Primacy Attractor encodes purpose
- Measure: Fidelity score every turn
- Analyze: Drift detection, phase classification
- Improve: Proportional intervention
- Control: Fidelity zones as SPC limits

## Empirical Validation Results

| Benchmark | Attacks | Result | Notes |
|-----------|---------|--------|-------|
| AILuminate (MLCommons) | 1,200 | ASR below detectable threshold | 95% CI upper bound: ~0.15% |
| MedSafetyBench (NeurIPS 2024) | 900 | ASR below detectable threshold | Healthcare-specific attacks |
| SB 243 Child Safety | 50 | ASR below detectable threshold | Conservative configuration |
| XSTest Over-Refusal | 250 | 8.0% FPR (down from 24.8%) | Domain-specific PA calibration |

**Total adversarial attacks tested:** 2,400+
**95% CI upper bound:** ~0.15% ASR under black-box threat model

The XSTest calibration demonstrates that safety does not require over-restriction. Domain-specific Primacy Attractors reduced false positive rates by 16.8 percentage points while maintaining adversarial resistance.

## SAAI Framework Alignment

**Framework:** Safer Agentic AI (SAAI) - Dr. Nell Watson
**Compliance Score:** 88% (39/47 requirements) - self-assessed
**External validation:** Planned through IEEE CertifAIEd process

The SAAI Framework addresses safety requirements specific to autonomous AI systems: goal drift, corrigibility, deception prevention, and human oversight.

### Implementation Status

| SAAI Requirement | TELOS Implementation | Status |
|------------------|---------------------|--------|
| Continuous drift tracking | Fidelity score every turn | Implemented |
| Flexibility scales with drift | Tiered response (NORMAL/WARNING/RESTRICT/BLOCK) | Implemented |
| 10%/15%/20% drift thresholds | `SAAI_DRIFT_WARNING`, `SAAI_DRIFT_RESTRICT`, `SAAI_DRIFT_BLOCK` | Implemented |
| Mandatory review triggers | `_trigger_mandatory_review()` with operator acknowledgment | Implemented |
| Cryptographic log integrity | SHA-256 hash chains per event | Implemented |
| Baseline fidelity capture | First N turns establish behavioral baseline | Implemented |
| Human override capability | `acknowledge_drift_block()` for operator intervention | Implemented |
| Values both machine-operational and human-readable | PA = embedding vector + purpose statement | Implemented |

### Identified Gaps

- Super-normal stimuli controls for companion/therapeutic use cases
- Multi-agent coordination protocols (planned for TELOS Gateway)

### Key Code Locations

- `telos_purpose/core/constants.py` (lines 466-507): SAAI threshold definitions
- `telos_purpose/core/governance_trace_collector.py`: Full SAAI integration

## DMAIC-SAAI Synthesis

TELOS implements the Lean Six Sigma DMAIC methodology as the operational framework for SAAI compliance:

| DMAIC Phase | SAAI Requirement | TELOS Implementation |
|-------------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Define** | Goal Alignment | Primacy Attractor purpose statement |
| **Measure** | Continuous Drift Tracking | Fidelity score calculation every turn |
| **Analyze** | Detect Misalignment | Governance trace analysis, phase detection |
| **Improve** | Proportional Control | F = K·e intervention scaling (K=1.5) |
| **Control** | Corrigibility | Three-tier escalation, SPC fidelity zones |

This synthesis applies methods validated over 50+ years in industrial quality control to AI alignment.

---

## Technical Implementation

### Two-Layer Fidelity System

```
Layer 1 (Baseline): raw_similarity < 0.20 → HARD_BLOCK
    Catches extreme off-topic content

Layer 2 (Basin):    normalized_fidelity < 0.48 → INTERVENTION
    Catches purpose drift within domain
```

### SAAI Tiered Response

```
Drift < 10%:  NORMAL   - Standard operation
Drift >= 10%: WARNING  - Mandatory review event logged
Drift >= 15%: RESTRICT - Tighten enforcement thresholds
Drift >= 20%: BLOCK    - Halt responses until human acknowledgment
```

### Cryptographic Audit Trail

Each governance event includes:
- `previous_hash`: SHA-256 hash of prior event
- `event_hash`: SHA-256 hash of (previous_hash + serialized event content)

This creates a tamper-evident chain where any modification invalidates all subsequent hashes.

## What These Results Suggest

1. **Alignment can be measured.** Fidelity scores provide quantitative evidence of purpose adherence rather than subjective assessment.

2. **Safety and precision are compatible.** Domain-specific configuration reduces false positives while maintaining adversarial resistance.

3. **Industrial quality methods apply.** DMAIC/Six Sigma methodologies translate to semantic governance.

4. **Audit trails can be tamper-evident.** Cryptographic hash chains provide forensic integrity without external infrastructure.

5. **Human authority can be architectural.** The Primacy Attractor is defined externally; the AI cannot modify its own governance constraints.

---

## Relationship to Adversarial Benchmarks

This alignment documentation accompanies the empirical validation results. Frameworks like SAAI describe what safety properties a system should have. Benchmarks like AILuminate and MedSafetyBench test whether the system actually has them.

Both are necessary. Frameworks without validation risk becoming compliance theater. Validation without frameworks risks ad hoc testing that misses important properties.

---

## Limitations and Future Work

- SAAI compliance is self-assessed; external validation planned
- Formal empirical convergence analysis of stability properties pending
- Multi-agent coordination (TELOS Gateway) not yet implemented
- Super-normal stimuli controls for therapeutic use cases not yet addressed
